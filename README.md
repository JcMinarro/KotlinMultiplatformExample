# Known problems

You might see:
Configuration on demand is not supported by the current version of the Android Gradle plugin since you are using Gradle version 4.6 or above. Suggestion: disable configuration on demand by setting org.gradle.configureondemand=false in your gradle.properties file or use a Gradle version less than 4.6.

Also:
Error:The modules ['android', 'mobile'] point to the same directory in the file system.
Each module must have a unique path.

# Hacks

Multiplatform development in Kotlin still have some limitations.
This is why I had to apply some hacks which are temporary.

## Native dependencies

Cannot declare Gradle dependencies on Konan yet, so we just include sources.

## Names generated by JS

Generated names for functions have mashed names. This is why from:
```
interface QuotationView {
    fun showQuote(quote: Quote)
}
```

We have function required named `showQuote_4z1tej$`

## Mixing Kotlin and Swift dependencies is not allowed in Konan

We cannot do:
```
class ViewController : UIViewController, QuotationView {

    override fun showQuote(quote: Quote) {
        textView.text = quote.text
        authorView.text = quote.person
    }

    //...
}
```

We need to do instead:
```
class ViewController : UIViewController {

    private val quotationView = object : QuotationView {
        override fun showQuote(quote: Quote) {
            textView.text = quote.text
            authorView.text = quote.person
        }
    }

    // ...
}
```
